# hcf-phidget-support
Adds java support for interfacing with Phidgets Interface kits

IMPORTANT!!!!

I just discovered (whilst trying it) that this code doesn't have support with the latested raspbian so it's effectively obsolete on that platform. Which is of course a very important platform. I'll need to configure hydracontrolfreak to use the latest phidget22 code. But not just yet.
