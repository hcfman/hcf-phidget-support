# hcf-phidget-support
Adds java support for interfacing with Phidgets Interface kits

IMPORTANT!!!!

I just discovered (whilst trying it) that this code doesn't have support with the latested raspbian so it's effectively obsolete on that platform. Which is of course a very important platform. I'll need to configure hydracontrolfreak to use the latest phidget22 code. But not just yet. YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO INSTALL THIS CURRENTLY!! It just won't work, but it's needed to the whole project build.

It shouldn't take long to fix. It's just not ready for phidgets on launch date.
